<p>We are interested in finding out whether there is a statistically
significant change in mass balance over the observed time period. For
these purposes we use <strong>R</strong> (version R version 4.1.2
(2021-11-01)) and an appropiriate statistical test called
<em>t-test</em>: <span class="math display">\[t = \frac{\overline{x} -
\mu_0}{s/\sqrt{n}}.\]</span></p>
